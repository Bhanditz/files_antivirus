Feature: Antivirus file size
	As a system administrator
	I want to be able to set the maximum file size for scanned files
	So that the system will not be overloaded

	Background:
		Given the administrator has enabled the files_antivirus app
		And the owncloud log level has been set to warning
		And the owncloud log has been cleared
		And user "user0" has been created

	Scenario: Files smaller than the upload threshold are checked for viruses
		Given parameter "av_max_file_size" of app "files_antivirus" has been set to "100"
		When user "user0" uploads file "eicar.com" from the antivirus test data folder to "/virusfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
		Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
		And the last lines of the log file should contain log-entries containing these attributes:
			| user  | app             | method | message               |
			| user0 | files_antivirus | PUT    | Infected file deleted |
		And as "user0" the file "/virusfile.txt" should not exist

	Scenario: Files bigger than the upload threshold are not checked for viruses
		Given parameter "av_max_file_size" of app "files_antivirus" has been set to "100"
		When user "user0" uploads file "eicar_com.zip" from the antivirus test data folder to "/virusfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
		Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
		And as "user0" the file "/virusfile.txt" should exist

	Scenario Outline: Files smaller than the upload threshold are checked for viruses when using chunking
		Given parameter "av_max_file_size" of app "files_antivirus" has been set to "100"
		And using <dav-path-version> DAV path
		When user "user0" uploads the following chunks to "/myChunkedFile.txt" with <dav-path-version> chunking and using the WebDAV API
			| 1 | X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7C |
			| 2 | C)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANT |
			| 3 | IVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*  |
		Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
		And the last lines of the log file should contain log-entries containing these attributes:
			| user  | app             | message               |
			| user0 | files_antivirus | Infected file deleted |
		And as "user0" the file "/myChunkedFile.txt" should not exist
		Examples:
			| dav-path-version |
			| old              |
			| new              |

	Scenario Outline: Files bigger than the upload threshold are not checked for viruses when using chunking
		Given parameter "av_max_file_size" of app "files_antivirus" has been set to "20"
		And using <dav-path-version> DAV path
		When user "user0" uploads the following chunks to "/myChunkedFile.txt" with <dav-path-version> chunking and using the WebDAV API
			| 1 | X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7C |
			| 2 | C)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANT |
			| 3 | IVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*  |
		Then the HTTP status code should be "<http-status-code>"
		And as "user0" the file "/myChunkedFile.txt" should exist
		Examples:
			| dav-path-version | http-status-code |
			| old              | 200              |
			| new              | 201              |

	Scenario: Files smaller than the upload threshold are checked for viruses when uploaded via public upload
		Given as user "user0"
		And user "user0" has created a public share of folder "FOLDER" with change permissions
		And parameter "av_max_file_size" of app "files_antivirus" has been set to "100"
		When the public uploads file "eicar.com" from the antivirus test data folder using the old WebDAV API
		Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
		And the last lines of the log file should contain log-entries containing these attributes:
			| user | app             | method | message               |
			| --   | files_antivirus | PUT    | Infected file deleted |
		And as "user0" the file "/FOLDER/eicar.com" should not exist

	Scenario: Files bigger than the upload threshold are not checked for viruses when uploaded via public upload
		Given as user "user0"
		And user "user0" has created a public share of folder "FOLDER" with change permissions
		And parameter "av_max_file_size" of app "files_antivirus" has been set to "100"
		When the public uploads file "eicar_com.zip" from the antivirus test data folder using the old WebDAV API
		Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
		And as "user0" the file "/FOLDER/eicar_com.zip" should exist

	Scenario: Files smaller than the upload threshold are checked for viruses when uploaded overwriting via public upload
		Given as user "user0"
		And user "user0" has created a public share of folder "FOLDER" with change permissions
		And parameter "av_max_file_size" of app "files_antivirus" has been set to "100"
		When the public uploads file "textfile.txt" from the antivirus test data folder using the old WebDAV API
		And the public overwrites file "textfile.txt" with content "X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*" using the old WebDAV API
		Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
		And the last lines of the log file should contain log-entries containing these attributes:
			| user | app             | method | message               |
			| --   | files_antivirus | PUT    | Infected file deleted |
		And the content of file "/FOLDER/textfile.txt" for user "user0" should be "Small text file without virus."

	Scenario: Files bigger than the upload threshold are not checked for viruses when uploaded overwriting via public upload
		Given as user "user0"
		And user "user0" has created a public share of folder "FOLDER" with change permissions
		And parameter "av_max_file_size" of app "files_antivirus" has been set to "60"
		When the public uploads file "textfile.txt" from the antivirus test data folder using the old WebDAV API
		And the public overwrites file "textfile.txt" with content "X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*" using the old WebDAV API
		Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
		And the content of file "/FOLDER/textfile.txt" for user "user0" should be "X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*"
